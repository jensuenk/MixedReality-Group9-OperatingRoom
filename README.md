## About
Our VR project introduces people to an operating experience. Usually, people already have a picture in their head of how an operation is going, but often that idea does not match reality. Which makes them afraid and nervous beforehand. 
This way, people with pre-operative-stress, kids, students and you can already have a look at how things are going before the operation starts. Our VR project is also informative. The out of body experience allows people to see what happens in such an operating room. Such as classical music in the background, the tasks of the nurse, doctor, anastisyst, etc ...
